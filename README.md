Hello, my name is Ary and I am a developer based in Canada. Being born and raised in Brazil, I went to Medical School and getting a Medical Degree, working 5 years as a family physician.

After moving to Canada, I decided to completely change my career from Medicine to Software Engineering due to my passion for technology and development. Since then I have been fully immersed in Development to the point I became completely passionate about it.
